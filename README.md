# aml.js
Aml.js is a framework that allows editing of AML. AML is a language similar to css, but uses attributes instead of styling. For example, this is AML syntax:<br>
&lt;div id="aml"><br>
.input{<br>
type: range;<br>
max: 100;<br>
min: 50;<br>
}<br>
&lt;/div><br>
Note: Put AML inside a div element with id aml. Only use a single element, put all aml in it.
